# SQL Advent Calendar 2024

This repository contains my solutions to Interview Master's 24-day SQL Advent Calendar challenge. 🎯 
This journey was all about consistency and leveling up my query optimization and data manipulation skills. Excited to keep building on this momentum!


# Key Technical Concepts Covered:
### Advanced Data Retrieval: 
Mastering SELECT statements with complex WHERE filtering and DISTINCT logic.

### Multi-Table Joins: 
Implementing INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOINs to consolidate data across multiple festive-themed datasets.

### Window Functions: 
Using RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER() to perform calculations across specific partitions of data.

### Aggregations & Grouping: 
Summarizing large datasets using SUM, AVG, and COUNT combined with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs): 
Writing clean, readable queries and managing multi-step data transformations using WITH clauses.

### Date & Time Manipulation: 
Handling time-series data, calculating intervals, and filtering by specific holiday periods.

### Conditional Logic: 
Using CASE statements to categorize data and handle complex business rules (like "Naughty vs. Nice" list logic).

### Data Cleaning & Parsing: 
Working with string manipulation, handling NULL values, and even basic JSON/XML parsing (depending on the specific daily tasks).

### Recursive Queries: 
Tackling hierarchical data structures and pathfinding using Recursive CTEs.
